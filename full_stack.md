# Full stack engineer

This coding exercise is intended to help us get to know each other through code. You get to see a small example of the types of problems our new full stack engineer will solve, and we get to see if your approach to coding is a fit for us. We expect this should take no more than 1-2 hours; if it takes much longer, stop and send what you have.

You should have received an API URL; this URL returns a JSON-API formatted list of bills for a utility meter. Each bill includes initial and closing dates, cost in dollars, peak (highest amount used, in kW), and use in kWh.

Using any tools you choose, write a tiny web application that loads this data and displays it on a page. You can display it however you choose: do something interesting (but donâ€™t spend more than an hour or two).

Be sure to include a URL where we can see the code and a description of how to run it (including installing dependencies, if needed).
