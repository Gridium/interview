# Backend engineer - Java/Python

More info on the position: https://gridium.com/about/working-at-gridium/backend-engineer/

This coding exercise is intended to help us get to know each other through code. You get to see a small example of the types of problems our new backend engineer will solve, and we get to see if your approach to coding is a fit for us. We expect this should take no more than 1-2 hours; if it takes much longer, stop and send what you have.

[pge_electric_interval_data.xml](pge_electric_interval_data.xml) is a sample XML file containing electricity usage data. Write a program to load this file, parse it, and output the data as CSV containing three fields: `usage point,occurred,value`. Occurred should be formatted like `2011-11-30T12:00:00.000Z` Use any language, libraries, and/or tools that will help you do this quickly and efficiently.

For reference, the schema is available from https://github.com/GreenButtonAlliance/OpenESPI-Common-java/blob/master/etc/espiDerived.xsd (although most of the schema details are not relevant for this problem).

Be sure to include a URL where we can see the code and a description of how to run it (including installing dependencies, if needed).
